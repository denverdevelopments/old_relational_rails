### Guiding Questions to Define The Relationship:
**What are each of our learning goals for this project? What drives us in this project?**
Our team goal is to complete a functional web page using Rails, and tables,
where each team member has a good comprehension level of concepts.

**What is your collaboration style? How do you feel about pair programming vs. divide-and-conquer approaches?**
The project calls for each person to design 2 databases, which suggests divide
and conquer.  But it will be in a co-working or collaborative setting since
each of our portions are similar in concepts, where we can share ideas.

**How do you communicate best? How do you appreciate receiving communication from others?**
Slack messages to document discussions and concepts.  For brainstorming, direct or
video meetings for more rapid fire discussions.

**How would you describe your work style?**
Branching procedure:  many new, small branch offshoots; that will close
Pom Breaks are a must, break at logical stop points
Github - Use comments and labels
Keep one main branch that both will approve to merge into.  Each person will worked
on a separate branch and invite for approval when ready.

**What are each of our strengths? How can our strengths complement each other?**
Kevin - computation/calculation in methods, generally collaborative.
Wyatt - clear communicator, flexible with scheduling.

**What’s gone well or poorly in your previous projects?**
*POORLY*
Asking for help
Confusion with merging
Struggled at project start
*WELL*
Code worked
Communication/responsiveness, flexibility

**How will we set direction and make decisions as a team?**
By discussing and finding a way to agree on a plan.

**How will we overcome obstacles?**
One at a time through discussion
Consult instructor/mentor if still stuck

**What do you need (resources, environment, communication) to do your best work?**
Good positive communication
Someone to help make decisions/input

**What scheduling restraints do you have? What are your scheduling preferences?**
Conflicts:  weds. 5-5:30
            try finish up by 10 or 11pm
General time to work on stuff 7 to 10pm rough work hours, check-in after class if needed.

**What is your style for giving feedback? Does anything ever hold you back from giving feedback?**
We will aim to keep feedback positive, while keeping negative feedback constructive (and not personal).  Try to be clear

**What do you identify as being your biggest strength(s) technically, as they relate to this project? Where do you feel you could use improvement in your technical skills, as they relate to this project? How can our team help support you in improving these skills?**
Wyatt - current on technical reading.  Kevin - good with keeping track of details.


**What tools do you want to use to manage the project?**
Zoom
Slack
Github
Atom
Terminal
GitHub projects
Tuple
- Scheduling time to work on project
- Special online tools for online paired programming???

**How do you want the group to solve problems when members run into issues with features of the project?**
Googling
Research
Ask for help from other team members, mentors, instructors, and others.

**How do you know if a project is successful? How can we achieve that as a group?**
If it runs and we get a good grade and we both contributed pretty fairly.
Whole team has understanding of code and functions.

**How will we recognize each other's successes and celebrate them?**
Pause, take a moment to enjoy and acknowledge.

*Additional Notes:*


**Any additional questions that you would like to add:**

### Remote Work Considerations During the COVID-19 Quarantine
**What does remote focus look like for you? (headphones, distractions minimized (tv, family stuff, etc), video on)**
KN:  Work in my office, with headphones if noise elimination is needed.

**When working from the same place where you live, life can get in the way. What are some potential life things that could affect your ability to focus, and what plan can we come up with to approach those moments?**
If we encounter issues such as power outages, Zoom difficulties, or bad wifi, what backup plans can we have in place? (This could have answers like asking a neighbor to borrow wifi, using cellphone hotspot for internet, switching to slack or skype.

**Pomodoro breaks are especially important for remote work and doubly so for quarantine. What should our Pom cadence look like? How will hold ourselves accountable?**
We will use our laptop times and remind each other if someone notices.

**Quarantine is tough, so it’s important to make note of our mental/emotional state when working with others. How can we make space to check in on each other’s well being, in addition to the work that needs to be done?**
